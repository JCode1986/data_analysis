# Data Analysis

**Author**: Joseph Hangarter
**Version**: 1.0.2

## Overview
* Utilizing 2 Jupyter Notebooks (`vg-stats` and `bike-stats`), and load data sets to Pandas DataFrame within each respective file.
* In the vg-stats notebook answer the following questions/do the following tasks. Note that the numbers quoted for sales are in the millions, and apply only for those games with over 10,000 sales.:
    * Which company is the most common video game publisher?
    * What’s the most common platform?
    * What about the most common genre?
    * What are the top 20 highest grossing games?
    * For North American video game sales, what’s the median?
    * Provide a secondary output showing ‘about’ ten games surrounding the median sales output
    * For the top-selling game of all time, how many standard deviations above/below the mean are its   sales for North America?
    * The Nintendo Wii seems to have outdone itself with games. How does its average number of sales compare with all of the other platforms?
    * Come up with 3 more questions that can be answered with this data set.
* In the bike-stats notebook, answer the following questions/do the following tasks:
    * What is the average trip duration for a borrowed bicycle?
    * What’s the most common age of a bicycle-sharer?
    * Given all the weather data here, find the average precipitation per month, and the median precipitation.
    * What’s the average number of bikes at a given bike station?
    * When a bike station is modified, is it more likely that it’ll lose bikes or gain bikes? How do you know?
    * Come up with 3 more questions that can be answered with this data set.

    * Select a Kaggle data set that is suitable for Linear Regression
    * Load the data you receive into a Pandas DataFrame
    * Show the first five rows of the data set
    * Show the description and the info of the data set
    * Ensure that any date columns have been cast into a datetime object in your DataFrame
    * Using a regression model, split your data into train and test data
    * Fit your training split to the regression model
    * Draw at least three conclusions from your regression model

    * Select 2 Kaggle data sets that is suitable.
    * Optionally use dataset built into Seaborn
    * Load the data you receive into a Pandas DataFrame
    * Show the first five rows of the data set
    * Show the description and the info of the data set
    * Visualize your dataset to demonstrate insights into the data
    * Verbalize your insights at bottom of notebook

## Getting Started
* run `pipenv shell`
* run `jupyter lab`
* web browser - `http://localhost:8890/lab`

## Architecture
